# Overview

Owl is a new programming language for cross-platform mobile
development.  Owl strives to:

- combine object-oriented programming and functional programming by
  rethinking the design of the language to make it easier to mix both
  paradigms,

- be a cross-platform mobile development language capable of being
  compiled to both Anroid and iOS,

- bridging the gap between the designer and the programmer by
  supplying tools and language features to make protyping possible by
  designers with no/low programming experience, 

- take accessibility as a serious part of its design, and

- be completely influenced by existing and new research in
  human-computer interaction and programming language design.
